For the first release, here is an example project on how to create a compilable programming book with sbt-scaliterate:

```
$ tree
.
├── project
│   └── scaliterate.sbt
└── src.scala.md

1 directory, 2 files
```

Add **sbt-scaliterate** as an sbt plugin to `project/scaliterate.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.wookietreiber" % "sbt-scaliterate" % "0.1.0")
```

You need to have a **single** Markdown file, your *programming book*. The default name of this file is simply called `src.scala.md`. It resides directly in your projects base directory.

    % Hello World
    
    # A Beginners Program
    
    Saying **Hello, world!** is very common when learning a new language.
    
    Here is how to do it in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/):
    
    ```scala
    package hello
    
    object Hello extends App {
      println("Hello, world!")
    }
    ```

The fenced Scala code blocks are automatically extracted from this Markdown file and compiled with sbt's `compile` task. Thus, to compile the project, simply type:

```
sbt compile
```
